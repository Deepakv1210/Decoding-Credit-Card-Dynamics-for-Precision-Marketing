# Precision Marketing Unveiled

## Overview
This project decodes the intricacies of credit card dynamics, empowering businesses with insights for precision marketing. Through histograms, correlation analyses, and cutting-edge clustering techniques, this endeavor provides a roadmap for crafting tailor-made marketing strategies for distinct customer segments.

## Instructions

### Data Exploration
Gain insights into the dataset by checking histograms for variables 2-18. This step helps us understand the distribution and patterns related to each variable.

### Correlation Analysis
Compute Pearsonâ€™s correlation between variables 2-18. Visualize the correlation matrix with a heatmap and discuss potential associations between different features.

### K-Means Clustering (Part c)
Apply K-Means clustering on variables 2-16. Use the elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters (K*). Report cluster statistics, centroids, and scatter. Discuss findings related to percent of full payment and tenure.

### K-Means Clustering (Part d)
Repeat K-Means clustering with a different feature combination. Discuss how the changes in feature selection impact clustering results.

### Gaussian Mixture Models (Part e)
Apply Gaussian Mixture Models using the subset of variables identified in part d. Report mean vectors, covariance matrices, and log-likelihood scores. Visualize covariance matrices using a heatmap.


Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to enhance the analysis and findings.
